//Step 1: Create a Java class "Student" that should have the following properties: First name, Last name, Student ID.
//Step 2: Create a Java List for elements of type "Student" and add multiple students.
//Step 3: Create a class "School" to which students can be added through a method ('addStudent').
//Step 4: Implement a method to print all students of the school (as text, to the console).
//Step 5: Add a method to find a student by their ID. The found student should be returned.
//Step 6: Create a method to remove a student from the school.
